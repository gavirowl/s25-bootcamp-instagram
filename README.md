This project is a replica of an Instagram page. It includes a profile picture, username, post, buttons, caption, and timestamp. To make this project,
I used common functions in the swift programming language such as VStack, HStack, and Image. In the future, I would implement an interactive like button
that turns red when clicked.

This project is the same as the last one. Instead, we used tools such as Views. This allowed for cleaner, more organized code.
